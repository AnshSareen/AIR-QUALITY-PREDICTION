# 🌍 Air Pollution Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts **real-time air pollution levels** using **Random Forest**. It fetches data , preprocesses it, and provides insights into harmful gases like **NO, PM10, NO3, and SO2**. The system is designed to handle large datasets efficiently and provide accurate air quality predictions.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Real-time Air Quality Prediction** using machine learning models.  
✅ **Data Collection & Preprocessing** to handle missing values and outliers.  
✅ **Random Forest** for accurate classification.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **visualization** for insights.  
✅ **Scalable & Efficient** to handle large datasets.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Random Forest
- **Data Clustering:**  Cosine Similarity  
 

## 📜 Installation & Usage
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Prediction Model
```sh
python AirQualityPredictor.py
```

### 3️⃣ View Results

- The system will process the dataset, train models, and display air quality predictions.
- Visualizations of pollutant levels will be generated.

## 📊 Data Processing Steps

1. **Data Collection:** Fetching pollution data from CPCB.
2. **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing data.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting meaningful features from pollutant data.
4. **Model Training:** Applying **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Trees**.
5. **Evaluation:** Using precision, recall, and confusion matrices to measure accuracy.

## 🏗️ Future Enhancements

🔹 **Expand Dataset** to include global pollution data.  
🔹 **User Interface (UI)** for real-time data visualization.  
🔹 **Deep Learning Models (LSTM)** for time-series forecasting.
